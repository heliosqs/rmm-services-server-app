# rmm-services-server-app
A Remote Monitoring and Management (RMM) software that allows to register and monitor devices.

# Setup
## Manual setup
This repository runs on a local postgres instance. Its build management is handled by gradle, a 
build automation tool. Steps to use this app:


1. You need to create a local database named `postgres`. By default, it requires the database to be 
   owned by the `postgres` username without a password.
2. To build the application without the test suite you can run the following command:
   `./gradlew build -x test`. This step will generate a jar of the project.
3. Run `java -jar build/libs/rmm-services-server-app-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT`, to execute the server. This 
   will create 
   the database with data 
   about the services and prices used by the application
4. You can access the server with the following URL: `http://localhost:8081/rmm/{endpoint}`

# Getting Started
## Authorization token
This server assumes that the user has a valid token. In order to get one send a POST request to the 
following endpoints:
`http://localhost:8081/rmm/api/customer/auth/1/` or `http://localhost:8081/rmm/api/customer/auth/2/`

This returns information from two pre-loaded users that can be used as part of the authorization 
header as follows:
`Authorization: Bearer ${token}`

## Managing devices
The server provides operations to create, update, delete and list devices. The next subsections 
will contain examples on how to use these endpoints.
